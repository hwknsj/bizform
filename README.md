## Concept

Imagine you want to start your own business: you have a great idea, motivation, yet find yourself inhibited by the process of merely establishing your brand–the fees involved vary state-to-state, the costs alone for which may be prohibitive (reminding you that capitalism is only for the wealthy), and on top of all the work one does to *operate* a business, you're faced with with filling out a series of forms, having to decipher cryptic language, and do hours of research to know what type of filing provides you–the aspiring small business owner, the backbone of the economy–the greatest benefit so you can realize your hard work without being penalized later on simply because you–like most people–do not have experts to guide you through a process of nuanced decision-making which, if not done properly the first time, could have repercussions that limit your success or earnings or agency as a business owner.

The inspiration for this demo looks towards democratizing the information and simplifying the complicated process of creating one's own company by providing a guided and informative platform. The opportunity to realize one's vision should not be restricted to those with the privilege of capital, access to expertise, or the luxury of time.
